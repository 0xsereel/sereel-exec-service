# sereel-exec-service

FastAPI execution service for Sereel delta-neutral hedges: Solana devnet funding and attestations, Hyperliquid
testnet hedging (`xyz:GOLD`, a HIP-3 market), a testnet market maker, and payouts. *(Work in progress; sections are
added as each part lands.)*

## Hyperliquid account modes (abstraction)

Hyperliquid accounts run in one of several modes, readable with `{"type": "userAbstraction", "user": <address>}`.
The service detects the mode of each account **at startup and logs it**.

| Mode | Used for | How margin works | What the service does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `default` | **Master account** (holds strategy margin) | Spot, the main perp balance and **each builder dex (`xyz`) keep separate balances.** USDC must be moved to the dex before trading there. | `ensure_margin` moves the shortfall to `xyz`, drawing on main perp first, then spot, via `sendAsset`. `release_margin` moves it back. The `xyz` balance is what per-strategy margins are reconciled against. |
| `unifiedAccount` / `portfolioMargin` | **Market-maker account** | Spot USDC is shared collateral across spot and every perp dex. There are no per-dex balances to fund. | Dex transfers are **skipped** (they are rejected anyway: "Must deposit before performing actions"). `ensure_margin` only checks that spot USDC covers the amount. |

The master stays `default` on purpose: the explicit `xyz` balance is what makes the reconciliation check
(`sum(strategy margins) <= xyz dex balance`) meaningful. If the master is ever switched to a unified mode, the
service logs a warning at startup, skips transfers, and per-dex reconciliation is no longer meaningful.

Moving margin between the main balance and a builder dex is a **user-signed** action, so it needs the master key
(`HL_MASTER_KEY`, development only). API (agent) wallets can trade but cannot move or withdraw funds.

## Testnet market maker

`sereel mm run --market XAU-HL` quotes both sides of `xyz:GOLD` from a separate account (`HL_MM_*`) so hedge orders
have a counterparty on the thin testnet book. It refuses to start unless `HL_API_URL` contains `testnet`
(independent of `ALLOW_MAINNET`).

- **Sizes:** 0.02-0.05 per level (`MM_MIN_SIZE` / `MM_MAX_SIZE`), 3 levels per side by default.
- **Center:** the Hyperliquid **oracle** price by default (`--center oracle|pyth|mark`). Testnet marks drift from the
  oracle (observed: mark 4211 vs oracle 4160); centering on the oracle pulls the mark back. A quote that would
  cross the book is sent GTC and takes the stale liquidity; a quote that rests safely is post-only (ALO). In a live
  run the mark-oracle gap fell from +51 to about +4..+7 while quoting, and re-opened after the maker stopped.
- **Inventory control:** quotes skew against inventory (long: both sides lower; short: both sides higher, up to
  `skew_bps` at the inventory limit), and the side that would grow inventory past `max_inventory` is dropped.
- **Shutdown:** Ctrl-C, SIGTERM or `sereel mm stop` cancels all quotes and flattens the position with a
  **reduce-only IOC**.
